# Knapsacks
## Introduction
- <b><i>Knapsack problems</i></b>
is one kind of problem in combinatorial optimization in which you 
need to find a set of items, with given value and size (such as weights 
and volumes), packed into a container with a maximum capacity in order to
achieve the highest value.

- In this repo, the demonstration of knapsack problems solving is given in several methods.
Initialy, it includes solving knapsacks demo in 
<b>Linear Programmming</b> 
and
<b>Meta Heuristic Algorithm</b>.

- In each method's folder, there are further analysis which help you to understand more detail 
the related features.
