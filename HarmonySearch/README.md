# Harmony Search Algorithm
- <i>The Harmony Search algorithm</i> is based on the performance process of jazz musicians. 
The group members of the jazz band try to find the best pitches to create a good harmony.
- Similar to it, the designers of engineering systems 
try to find the best parameters to create an optimized system.

## About the demo
### Quick intro
> I use the Python build-in library 
[pyHarmonySearch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyHarmonySearch)
as a tool for my implementation to solve this problem.<br><br>
> To understand more about how the solver is implemented.
You may refer to the source code documentation.<br>
> -> https://github.com/gfairchild/pyHarmonySearch <br><br>
> Special thanks to Geoffrey Fairchild for providing the tool.
