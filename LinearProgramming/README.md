# Linear Programming
- <i>Linear Programming</i> is the name given to computing the best solution to a problem modeled as a set of linear relationships. 

## About the demo
### Quick intro
> The linear programming demo is built with [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization).<br><br>
> For the further instructions in setting up OR-Tools, please refer to its developer guides: <br>

### Example used (Archive)
Given a N set of items with distinct value and weight. Find the maximum value that an W capacity can hold.
<br><br>
<code>N = 5</code><br>
<code>W = 250</code><br>
<code>List Value = [3, 6, 5, 10, 8]</code><br>
<code>List Weight = [2, 7, 1, 3, 4]</code><br>
<pre>
            Value   Weight
  Item 1:     3       2               
  Item 2:     6       7
  Item 3:     5       1
  Item 4:    10       3
  Item 5:     8       4
</pre>

## Note
> The C++ demo is pending because the environment and library setting up is taking too long.
